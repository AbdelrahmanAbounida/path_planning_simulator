This simulation environment was built for a bigger project (Controlling Mobile Robot using ROS)

- ** optimization**: this package returns the best optimized stations' order with the shortest path to reach under some constraints.
- ** path_planning**: this package calculates the shortest path from the first point to the final goal.
